NAME

  Array::Compare

DESCRIPTION

WHAT IS Array::Compare?

  Array::Compare is a Perl module which allows you to compare two arrays.

  It has a number of features which allow you to control the way that the
  arrays are compared:

  * white space in array elements can be significant or ignored.
  * particular columns in the arrays can be ignored.

  Additionally you can get a simple true/false return value or the number
  of columns which differ or an array containing the indexes of the
  differing columns.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

  Array::Compare uses the standard Perl module architecture and can
  therefore by installed using the standard Perl method, that is,

    cpanm Array::Compare

  or

    cpan Array::Compare

  (possibly with sudo in front).
  
  You can always download it from CPAN or Github, and then...

    gzip -cd Array-Compare-X.XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd Array-Compare-X.XX
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

  Where X.XX is the version number of the module which you are installing.

  If this doesn't work for you then creating a directory called Array
  somewhere in your Perl library path (@INC) and copying the Compare.pm
  file into this directory should also do the trick.

WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

  All of the documentation is currently in POD format in the Compare.pm
  file. If you install the module using the standard method you should	be
  able to read it by typing

    perldoc Array::Compare

  at a comand prompt.

LATEST VERSION

  The latest version of this module will always be available from CPAN.
